# Health Care Security Attacks Dashboard

According to the [US Department of Health and Human Services](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/2020-hph-cybersecurty-retrospective-tlpwhite.pdf),  in almost every month of 2020, more than 1 million people were affected by data breaches at healthcare organizations. This was a 9851% increase from 2019, leading to security exploitations in 560 total healthcare organizations. To foster discussion around these issues, I coded in 2023 an interactive data dashboard using R that would allow patients and healthcare providers to fully understand the magnitude of such incidents. [The data](https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf) for this dashboard is continuously updated from public domain data provided by the DHHS.
