# Health Care Security Attacks Dashboard

According to the US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), in almost every month of 2020, more than 1 million people were affected by data breaches at healthcare organizations. This was a 9851% increase from 2019, leading to security exploitations in 560 total healthcare organizations. To foster discussion around these issues, I developed an interactive data dashboard using R that would allow patients and healthcare providers to fully understand the magnitude of such incidents. The data for this dashboard is continuously updated from public domain data provided by the DHHS. This project has been presented at the Association for Computing Machinerâ€™s 14th International Conference for Computational Biology, Bioinformatics, and Health informatics.
